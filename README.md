This project was created by AbdulRahman AlHamali and AbdulRahman El Taha as project for EECE624 course in the American University of Beirut with Prof. Ali Chehab
The project calculates the testability measures of circuits. It calculates combinational controllability, combinational observability, and the hardest 10% lines to test in the circuit 

To run the code. Run:
python calculate_testability_measures.py -i {{name_of_bench_file}} -o {{name_of_output_file}}

For example:
python calculate_testability_measures.py -i C17.txt -o output.txt
